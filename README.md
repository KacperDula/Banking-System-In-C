## Banking System in C using Structs and Pointers  

Developed a simple banking system in C that uses structures to store account details and pointers for efficient data handling.  

Implemented a menu-driven interface for:  
- Login authentication  
- Balance inquiry  
- Deposits  
- Withdrawals  

Used pointer-based function calls to modify account balances directly, ensuring optimized memory usage and real-time updates.
